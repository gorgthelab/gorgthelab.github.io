Graduate student Dominic Kafka submitted his first articles to the arXiv named [Visual interpretation of the robustness of Non-Negative Associative Gradient Projection Points over function minimizers in mini-batch sampled loss functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08552) and [Gradient-only line searches: An Alternative to Probabilistic Line Searches](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09383) respectively. 
These works showcase the utility of gradient-only concepts in neural network related problems. Specifically, the gradient-only definition of an optimum was implemented to resolve the learning rates using inexact gradient-only line searches.
