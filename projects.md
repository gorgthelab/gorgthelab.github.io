**GOLS-I** <br>
A project championed by Dominic Kafka, whereby the concepts of gradient-only optimization are incorporated into an inexact gradient-only line search method (GOLS-I). This method is used to resolve the learning rates of neural network training problems dynamically. As opposed to minimization line search approaches, GOLS-I is compatible with continual mini-batch sub-sampling during training. Therefore this project seeks to remove the learning rate as a tunable hyperparameter in neural network training, instead making use of GOLS-I to relove step sizes dynamically.
